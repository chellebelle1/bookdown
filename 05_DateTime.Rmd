# DateTime R Package 

## Introduction
This is a user guide for the `DateTime` package, which allows you to perform operations or calculations with date and time. See this guide for explanations and examples of the functions in this package. 

## Installation
To use the `DateTime` package, use the code below in your console. 

```{r setup, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# install packages "usethis" and "devtools" if they are not already installed 
library(usethis)
library(devtools)

# Load the DateTime package in 
library(DateTime)
```

## Fuctions of the package 
The package contains 4 functions which are related to date and time. 

- `date_difference()`

- `add_time()`

- `is_same_day()`

- `is_dutch_holiday()`


### Calculating date difference 
The `date_difference()` function allows you to calculate the difference between two dates. The function uses various time units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.

```{r, date_difference, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Load the DateTime package
library(DateTime)

# Calculate the difference between two dates in days
date_difference("2024-05-21", "2024-05-22", units = "days")
# Calculate the difference between two dates in weeks
date_difference("2024-05-21", "2024-06-21", units = "weeks")
# Calculate the difference between two dates in years
date_difference("2024-05-21", "2025-05-22", units = "years")

```

### Add time to a date 
The `add_time()` function adds a certain amount of time to the filled in date. 
```{r, add_time, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Add 1 hour
add_time("2024-05-21 08:00:00", 1, "hours") 
# Add 2 weeks 
add_time("2024-07-22 07:00:00", 2, "weeks") 
# Add 54 seconds
add_time("2024-05-21 08:00:00", 54, "seconds") 
```

### Check if two dates are on the same day
The `is_same_day()` function checks whether two dates fall on the same weekday. If so, it returns "TRUE" and gives the name of the weekday. If not, it returns "FALSE" and gives you the two different weekday names. 

```{r, same day, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Check if the 21st of May 2024 falls on the same day as 21st of May 2024. 
is_same_day("2024-05-21", "2024-05-21")
# Check if the 4th of May 2024 falls on the same day as the 2nd of February 2024
is_same_day("2024-05-04", "2024-02-02")
```

### Check for Dutch holidays
The `is_dutch_holiday()` function checks if the given date, is also a (legal) Dutch holiday. 
These holidays are:

- New Year's Day

- Goede Vrijdag / Good Friday

- Easter

- Second Easter Day

- King's Day

- Liberation Day (every 5 years)

- Ascension Day

- Pentecost

- Second Pentecost

- Second Christmas Day

```{r, Dutch holiday, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
is_dutch_holiday("2024-01-01")
is_dutch_holiday("2024-08-12")
```
